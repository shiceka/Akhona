# introduction
I didn't work on much of the FreeCode Camp as we had a presentation with the seniors presenting
work they were busy with and then wew had questions after. We had a lesson on click event buttons. 


# body
The seniors after presenting wanted to show us some of the things they had been working on. So rather than them 
teaching us what they were doing we asked them to teach us something we could need or learn for use. So we had 
learned how to use functions in javascript and add click on events to the submit button. We have to add this knowledge 
onto the RSVP project we had done earlier. We are still working on it and the use of this JS addition to the HTML and CSS files
we have already on the RSVP form. 



# conclusion
Although we did not get much work done I feel that we learnt a lot and have to now show that what we learned we can put to use.
It is a little tricky but getting through it is a must, and working with the other juniors is also proving helpful.
