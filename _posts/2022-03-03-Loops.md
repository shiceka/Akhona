# introduction
First thing of the day seems to be the kata and todays kata had us use the modulo operator. This asks us to divide
two numbers and return the divisions remainder. We had to figure out a way to do this but make sure that the outcome 
was always strictly equal to 0. This was hard to figure at the beginning as we thought we were to divide.
Then I raced on to check out loops and wow, what trickery is this I thought.


# body
Loops allow us to run the same code multiple times. With this we met the "While loop" and says while a certain condition is true 
run the code over and over again until it becomes false then stop. The most common loop though is the "for loop" as it runs for a specified 
number of times. The "for loop" is declared with three optional expressions seperated by semi-colons: for(a;b;c) , a is the initialization 
statement, b is the condition statement and c is the final expression which increments or decrements.
