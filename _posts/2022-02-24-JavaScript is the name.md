# introduction
Today I began with JavaScript and learnt quiet a bit. So basic javascript is a programming language that in this case is used hand in hand with Web development. We have just touched the fundamentals of it so I shall be explaining more on this as the days go.


# body
Today I touched on the fact that javascript is used in one way to compute functions, mathematical functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, division and calculating a remainder of an improper division function. We use the mathematical operands "+ , -, *, / and %" respectively for the above mentioned functional operands. We also have to declare and initialize variables and this is done by either making a variable a certain format so to put it. A variable can either be declared as a "var", "let", "const" (constant, meaning it doesn't really change thus immutable) or "string". With the first learnt type 'var myVar = 5;' this would mean that the variable myVar is of type var and has been given the value 5. Now with variable names they are written in camelCase as good practice. Now we can declare variables with the knowledge that the types var, let and const can either be a number and/or string. After declaring two numbered varialbes we can perform mathematical functions for example:
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var answer;
we can then compute answer= x + y; then check for our result using console.log(answer);
and we will see the number 15.


# conclusion
There are more computations of this which i have touched yet not fully understood. I shall leave this here cause I think I may understand it.

var i = 2;
var myVal;
myVal = i += 5;
console.log(myVal);
the result is 7.
from this i understood that i= i + 5;
thus i = 2 + 5; this is what I think I have picked up and understood for the day.
