# introduction
Learning how to use the terminal and visual studio code to day. Getting introduced to github.


# body
I started learning how to use the terminal which is similar to the cmd on windows yet using slightly different ways to get around it. Although not that new it is interesting getting to operate almost everything using the terminal. I got visual studio code as well and this is me blogging about it on visual studio code. Opened a new file and a folder, the naming is different cause of the .md and the underscore used. Github is also new and I have yet to learn what is needed on all three platforms to polish myself and get better suited to use them to code.



# conclusion
A good and productive day to learn new things and a start of a new me.
