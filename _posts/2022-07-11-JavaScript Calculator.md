# introduction
The JavaScript calculator was next on the projects and I need say not easy.


# body
The way in which we had to do it compared to the compared calculators shows just how much we are 
yet to learn so as to apply. React and Redux are still a new and different as well as tough to understand.



# conclusion
I am almost finished but I would like to go back and find new ways to apply.
