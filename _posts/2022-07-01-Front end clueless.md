# introduction
Having the month of June coming to a close, we had to have finished the Frontend development libraries section.
That was a possibility, but the fact remains that it's understanding is not clear. 


# body
Yes, the challenges are done the section is completed yet if asked to create a react-redux app it would literally be dark.
The fact that some of the sections gone through were not clear as well as sometimes how the tests were passed is a mystery.
Having done the work is good, but what does not sit well is that I have no understanding. It is for this reason that I have gone the length to try get as many videos and read through blogs on sites to actually try and get a little bit of clarity. 


# conclusion
The push was there but the vital part still remains that I have no clue whatsoever about what I have covered. Redux for me was the first stumbling block and even after trying to read the code to try understand it has been difficult.
