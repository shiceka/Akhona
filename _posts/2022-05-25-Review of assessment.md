# introduction
We went through the first assessment and got to asking what it was that did not work.


# body
It is absolutely heartbreaking to have learned that instead of the final push I sent the first push to Moral and that is why the marks were so low. I am upset still but wish to do better in the second chance. 



# conclusion
I am lost for words though...
