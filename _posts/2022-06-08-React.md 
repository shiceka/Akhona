# introduction
So I have been continuing with React and in as much as I have been pushing, but at a slightly slower pace I have not been grasping much. 


# body
React is a library which seems to have a lot of things to it and has a bit more JavaScript than one thought.
I have so much to try and understand and have seen that most of the people around do not use the React 
taught. I am still stuck on class based components while the others use functional based components.
I will conform later on once I truly understand what is what. 



# conclusion
For now I am sticking to:
 class MyComponent extends React.Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <div><button>Button one</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
};
