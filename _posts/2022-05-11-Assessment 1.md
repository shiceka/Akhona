# introduction
The past couple of days have been a roller-coaster as I was trying to prepare for the assessment we wrote today.


# body
The time frame was good enough but the nerves and lack of concerntration made the task seem harder than it asctually was. Eventually I got it done and must say I feel confident about the work submitted.



# conclusion
The stress of having to submit after a number of commits and pushes has me on edge.
