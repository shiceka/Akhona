# introduction
Learning how to style our sites quickly and how we add logic to css styles then extend them is what we we will be doing. 


# body
Bootstrap and jQuery are the first of such to be used. With bootsrap we design mobile-responsive web pages using built in css styles and classes. We have styled buttons adding color and icons to them, gave them 100% width all just using classes. In form elements have also been adapted to such using <div> blocks mainly for such. New classes have been used such as 'well' to create a visual sense of depth for our columns. We have used icon blocks <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> to add an information circle to the button for instance. 

# conclusion
Having touched on these I intend to go on and further complete the rest of the section as it is quicker on some parts than using a styling section which is CSS.
