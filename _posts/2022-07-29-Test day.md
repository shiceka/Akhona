# introduction
Today the test was due and funny enough it was not as bad as I had thought it to be.


# body
We had to create a form that would take in the name and surname submit and delete from the table or list. This 
although sounding simpler than when it has to be done was actually a bit of a confidence booster. All along having done 
just a little bit had demotivated, but now things are looking good.



# conclusion
After this test and having had Tumi's help it seems futile to not ask for help and mini pet projects.
