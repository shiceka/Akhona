# introduction
So I am back at where I left off yesterday. I have a bit of light moving forth as I had to skip some of the challenges and do what I could. By me I finished the chapter, but unhappily so as I was clueless on the beginning.  

# body
I went back to the challenges that I had done from the beginning of this chapter and went through the challenges only to understand some with the exception of about four to five concepts which Njabulo would have taken us through, but then time whizzed by and we only realised just before time was done. I wrote down what I could understand and went through it so as to try explain to mom at home, lol this would allow me to understand greater too. I am not happy moving forth to the last chapter before the projects having not understood what could be key concepts so I hope to have the understanding needed by the end of tomorrow. 


# conclusion
I have spoken to one of my fellow juniors and it seems that there are in fact two more who did not understand. I asked that we work on the certain challenges together as a team just so we can understand. It is really frustrating going home without a real good understanding of something.
