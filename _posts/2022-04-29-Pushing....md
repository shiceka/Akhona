# introduction
Been trying to gather some information regarding the further understanding of concepts like localStorage and retrieving data even deeper.


# body
Went on to a number of blogs trying to see what other people are saying. I can not understand some of the things said and some just go off topic. I have found a blog site that Njabulo suggested we use rather than youTube all the time.



# conclusion
Medium is a blog that has a lot of topics covered besides coding but it is very insightful as it is almost similar to wikipedia though.
