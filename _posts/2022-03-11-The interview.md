# introduction
Having a Friday that was like no other so far. Having a surprise visits and one day that may have changed many ahead. Learning how to conduct oneself and know what to do when going for an interview, has had to be something not only I have needed. I think everyone who attended learnt a lot.


# body
We had a visit from Tanille whom I got to meet for the first time in person and Natalie who was here to give us a guide on interviews. This exercise was a first for me and an enlihhtning experience. Having spoken and asked questions on the to do's around no goes when attending interviews like punctuality and the manner of dress code. Learning about the company's profile is important too just as knowing now that I can ask questions pertainig the interviewers prior to the interview and doing proper research on the panel. As well as the company itself. Taking a note pad into the interview is also advised, this is for taking notes, questions you would like asked again should you not have understood and jotting down questions you would like to ask at the end.



# conclusion
There are a great number of points to take into consideration such as the STAR technique which asks you about a particular Situation, Task at hand, Action taken by you(remember to refer to this as first person "I") and the Result at the end of whatever situation was asked of you. Not many recieve this opportunity I still say.
