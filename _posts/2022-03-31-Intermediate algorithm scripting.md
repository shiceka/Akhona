# introduction
Digging deep and trying to get out the way is a stress. Facing challenges that keep you at a question for almost an hour or two and still not getting a pass.

# body
I have been at this for almost the whole day attempting to solve the problems without asking for too much help or getting the hints. Yes its time consuming, but I feel like this is the only way I can test myself and get to push myself farther. I would not like to admit defeat but right now I am at a depth I may just have to ask help and get through this chapter.


# conclusion
Not much progress but little progress is a lot compared to having hints and others do it for you.
