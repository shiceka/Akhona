# introduction
The name of the game is push til you drop. I have been having some flu symptoms and it has been difficult to concerntrate, but I need to push.

# body
I managed to get through some codewars challenges and try push through the freecode camp challenges. It is saucy cause they test one on all the work pushed throughout the previous sections of the Javascript... I am somewhat impressed with my progress and I shall be done with JavaScript by weeks end.

# conclusion
I have had a positive yet difficult day in terms of work positive, but healthwise not so fortunate. The day has been good to me as the many others before it.
