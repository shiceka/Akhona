# introduction
I continued and completed the first project, I then jumped onto the second one...The markdown previewer.


# body
Had a lot of trouble getting this one to function correctly. I had to for the first time ask for help from 
the seniors. Even then we had problems with getting the "dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: marked(this.state.markdown)}}" 
to work. Everytime we used it the display would disappear and that was the problem. It took us almost the whole day to get it to function. Asked Moral to help and it still was stubborn I ended up re-writing the program four times trying to see where I had gone wrong. 



# conclusion
I have not passed all the tests but the ones that I did pass I ran with, I will go back to stackoverflow and other sites to try get a working solution.
