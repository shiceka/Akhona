# introduction
Was busy with code wars and typing club for majority of the day...Was able to rack up the points and get higher ranking class.


# body
I am currently sitting on 175 points and I think I lost myself to the katas and was just trying to solve a lot of the katas in my class and classes higher.
Typing accuracy is pretty high yet the typing speed seems to fluctuate and defluctuate from day to day. I do not understand but I do hope to reach a typing speed equivalent to Mondli's. I shall try to complete a few other harder katas so as to get the score to reach 200 at least. I just only finished React and downloaded a video on Redux. 



# conclusion
The day was pretty productive in that I have challenged myself with the katas and hopefully can think outside the box in terms of problem solving and logic when it comes to JavaScript.
