# introduction
Went through some old react apps from FCC to try and see just how much I know. 


# body
We have a test to write tomorrow based on React. We had a todo-list application to do and could not get it
to get to what is needed. Tumi helped us with the react app and we picked up that most of the Free Code Camp 
things are not up to scratch. We now have a better understanding and could gradually get to work on React apps
by ourselves. 



# conclusion
We have noticed that in order to complete a few things we have to think outside the box. Looking at the delete method
for instance made me realise that filtering out the one thing not wanted works better than trying to go and remove it.
