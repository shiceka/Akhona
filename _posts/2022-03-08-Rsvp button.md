# introduction
Researching and asking the seniors for help on getting the form to do what it is meant to do.
 The additions given to us today after having a somewhat working version was also time consuming.


# body
Working with a classmate to try get through the task at hand which is the events buttons and getting the information 
to display is a bit stressing, but exciting at the same time. We have been at this and even lost track of time, and having to 
come back to this for a third day is in itself a problem that one really wants to solve. With that I have given myself the task of 
going through videos even when i am home.



# conclusion
This project is really pushing me and I am happy to be working on it. With the classmates here and the help offered nothing seems 
impossible.
