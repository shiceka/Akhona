# introduction
Functional Programming is another commom and highly usesd way for software development, code is made and used in smaller, basic blocks which when combined make a big functional program.


# body
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without much or any side effects outside of the function scope. This is where our input goes into the process stage and then delivers to us an output.
Isolated functions mean that there is no depending on the programs state, including any changeable variables including those declared globally. Pure functions simply state that the same input will always yield the same output. Lastly the functions have limited side effects, this means any changes to the programs state outside of the function are concisely controlled.  

# conclusion
Functional programming is a declarative programming paradigm with which function definitions are trees of expressions mapping values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions
