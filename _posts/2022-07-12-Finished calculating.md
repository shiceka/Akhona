# introduction
The calculator was almost done yesterday.


# body
I managed to research some finished calculators and got ideas and ways to actually finish it.
The calculator is finished and must thank some of the other students who helped where I did not understand.
I will now look into the 25 + 5 clock project before moving back to the incomplete project.



# conclusion
The end of one project simply means the beginning of the next.
