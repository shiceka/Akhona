# introduction
So after yesterday it was not great, we had eventually asked for some sort of 
help and explanation from the seniors.


# body
Tumi helped us by starting a tutorial for us seeing that we had not done this in a while.
With the other topics we were helped and this was a learning light and curve. I feel this
was needed and all of us appreciated the help, the session ended due to Tumi having another 
commitment later on.  



# conclusion
We hope to continue with this tomorrow and by Monday have some clarity on the subject.
