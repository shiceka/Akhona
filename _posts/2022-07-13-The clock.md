# introduction
Started a new project yesterday and have to go through all of its requirements to pass the test.


# body
The tests are coming about just well thus far yet I know that it will be challenging as we move along.
I will have to ask and work with the lady sitting next to me Noxi to try and get through the project timeously.
I wish to google and get it over and done with, but that in turn will render my learning curve negatively
 in the long run. 


# conclusion
I wish to finally finish the project and tests just fine.
