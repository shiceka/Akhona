# introduction
I went back to basics on this post because I feel like I have some things which I seem to have forgotten.
 I started by going to the old challenges done and tried to see if I could recreate them. 

# body
Create a textfield: <input type="text"> now from this it is important to remeber that input elements are self closing. We can go on to 
adding placeholder text to the textfield and make it manditory to insert something in it by making it required. <input type="text" placeholder="enter name" required>.
We then also add radio buttons as well as checkboxes, with these we give them a value so that on the form we don't just have an on or off next to the button not knowing what that on or off are for. <label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked>Outdoor</label>
We have a label for the radio button, we have given it an "id" as well as radio group name, to that we have made the radio checked by default. The same can be done for a checkbox.  

# conclusion
Not forgetting that we give almost all the sections a div with either a class name or id. This makes it simpler for when we have to style things in the css(cascading style sheet) folder. Remembering that this is where we manage the way our page actually looks. Watch out you do not add too many div's though as this may cause problems.
