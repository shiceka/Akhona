# introduction
Continuing with where I had left off with visual studio yesterday. Opening a new repository 
in github and starting with my first project that was given to us by Njabulo. Taking on the typing club 
and realising that I need to improve a great deal more on learning how to type faster.   


# body
From where I was yesterday in terms of getting on with my first work on visual studio code and 
starting an actual project on it. This was a step in a new direction as I am now working more on visual studio rather than codepen. Had to create an RSVP form using html and css on visual studio and learning new things on its terminal as well as the computers terminal. I have learned some git commands which clone, add, check status, commit and push work onto github. I then worked on typing club to try improve my typing skills which need to be improved greatly. I am currently sitting on 12wpm which is very low and should try get to at least 16wpm by weeks end.  



# conclusion
In closing of the day I have to improve on my typing skills. I need to work harder and longer on the newly started github, visual studio code and the terminal command. Other than that all is positive as this was a learning day and one that has had me improve myself by a step or two.
