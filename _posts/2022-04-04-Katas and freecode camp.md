# introduction
I have been pushing freecode camp and katas on the codewars. I have not been getting much going as I have been feeling down and cold.


# body
I have been coding on the freecode camp trying to push the javascript but it seems not to want to end I am a few challenges from being done with the intermediate algorithms which are a challenge. I have been also helping some of the other junior coders with the challenges and that may be the reason I am almost lacking. I have tried to push some katas as well and have shown that one needs more resources to get this whole coding thing than just freecode camp. Otherwise I am still enjoying the play with code although frustrating as some of my code just fails. With some katas passing 50% and getting assistance from the likes of Mark it all seems to be going okay.


# conclusion
This is better than I had hoped and I did not expect to have such a good environment to help me grow.
