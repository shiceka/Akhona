# introduction
Today I did not get a chance to do much work, as I had to push the project that was given to us due on Monday.


# body
I had pushed the project throughout the week but I still could not complete it cause I had a minor issue with the edit button. I eventually got it to work and all of the programs functionality is on point and should I have to work on it still it would have to be on spicing it up. I am also trying to complete and push the freecode camp JavaScript section as we were given a mandate to finish it by month end. Two sections left and still slow on it.

# conclusion
With that I have to finish all of my work by weeks end and I will play catch up later.
