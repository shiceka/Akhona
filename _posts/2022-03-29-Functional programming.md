# introduction
Working on the challenges of functional programming and failing to follow what was going on.

# body
I asked Njabulo to come over to explain some of these concepts as I was finding myself getting hints to complete challenges. After three hints I just was lost I could not gather what was happening or perhaps it was a lack of concerntration. Njabulo then said he would organized a presentation better explaining so that maybe all the newbies could interact as some may not want to say out loud that they also did not understand. I then went on to the internet to try and get some explanation before the presentation so I could come with some kind of information too. I found examples that were not clear too.  



# conclusion
I went back to the challenges trying to breakdown the code but some of it made no sense, I promise that tomorrow I will be better informed.
