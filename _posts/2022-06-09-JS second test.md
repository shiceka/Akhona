# introduction
Today we wrote our second JavaScript test, we got more explanation than in the first one.

# body
We were told that our functions should all take in parameters and not actually have local data in them.
For a couple I tested with the same global object Array and it seemed to work just fine. I had some time getting 
one of the functions to do as I wished but after some careful consideration it worked. I am now pleased with 
the work and hope to recieve good marks. 

# conclusion
With the test we get surprise tests so one can not truly study or prepare properly like we did in school.
Although tough we get tested and try best to apply the gained knowledge. Here is to more learning and a whole 
lot more applying ;).
