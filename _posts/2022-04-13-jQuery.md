# introduction
Finally finished the bootstrap section and jumped onto the jQuery section.


# body
So this is a popular JavaScript library and is very useful and helpful. We have had to use some JavaScript in here but first we had to have opening and closing script tags which we run the JavaScript in. They look like this: <script> </script>, we also have to add this vital piece of code with our script tags: $(document).ready(function() {}); without this function our browser will run our code before the html page has been rendered and this may cause bugs. All jQuery functions start with $(dollar sign), and we also often select HTML elements using what we call a selector then we do somethig with the selected element: $("button").addClass("animated bounce"); with this we have now made all our button elements on the form bounce.


# conclusion
$("button") this is the part where we selected the buttons. Then we added some CSS classes to them using the .addClass("animated bounce"). Using jQuery's addClass() function which allowed us to add classes to elements.
