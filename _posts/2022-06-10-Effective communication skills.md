# introduction
We were surprised by a Mrs.Carolyn Diaz, who came to talk to us about effective communication skills
 and how we would be able to unlock our potential to embrace our power.

How one communicates, and how one manages their skills and time, is essential to achieve maximum
 personal effectiveness. Personal effectiveness is the way that a person makes use of their skills,
 how they communicate their strengths and talents, and how they use those talents to improve their overall success. 
Effective communication skills to compliment your personal effectiveness:
-Eye contact
-Firm Handshake
-Body Language
-How you introduce yourself
-Good Listening Skills – Gain context
-Email etiquette
-Formal email communication – what it should look like.
We also touched on how one can increase their personal effectiveness:
*Understand Yourself and the day to day choices you make.
*Learn about individual behaviour styles to maximise your communication with others.
*Become Accountable for your behaviour, communication, thinking skills and professionalism.
*Build Self-Awareness about strengths, skills sets, and other areas in your life.
*Improve your Communication abilities with co-workers, management, and team members.
*Achieve Goals that will result in growth, change and increased effectiveness.
With the above mentioned the results should be:
Understanding of others behaviour and respect of individual differences
Self-confidence, self-motivation and commitment to growth
Greater listening and communication skills
Clearly defined goals and understanding of self.
Thus greater engagement will lead to improved and increased productivity.


# conclusion
We had an exercise to perform and greet each other and introduce ourselves as though we were meeting for the first time. This was an effort to gain confidence and use the skills taught to us from the workshop. With this we were given homework too.
