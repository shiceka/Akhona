# introduction
React Redux provides a small API with two key features: Provider and connect. Another challenge covers connect. The Provider is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app. This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux store and dispatch functions throughout your component tree.


# body
Provider takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of your app. Defining the Provider for an App component might look like this:

<Provider store={store}>
  <App/>
</Provider>

The Provider component allows you to provide state and dispatch to your React components, but you must specify exactly what state and actions you want. This way, you make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs. You accomplish this by creating two functions: mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps().
In these functions, you declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and which action creators you need to be able to dispatch. Once these functions are in place, you'll see how to use the React Redux connect method to connect them to your components in another challenge.

Note: Behind the scenes, React Redux uses the store.subscribe() method to implement mapStateToProps().



# conclusion
The mapDispatchToProps() function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. It's similar in structure to the mapStateToProps() function you wrote in the last challenge. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component props. However, instead of returning a piece of state, each property returns a function that calls dispatch with an action creator and any relevant action data.
