# introduction
Today I worked on mostly the RSVP project and did some work on typing club.


# body
So I worked mainly on the RSVP project today cause I was having some problems with the laptop being extremely slow for some reason. I managed to push most of the form and I'm left on finishing a few things on the styling before I can fully complete it. The background and the play on color is the main issue right now but should be finished with it by tomorrow. 
I also worked on my typing and tried to get my words per minute up by a bit and i still have a long way to go. At this rate I get through what i had put for myself at the beginning of the week. 



# conclusion
Today was progressive although not as well as one would have liked but there was progress. I have put myself through some paces and tomorrow i wish to take on from there and climb to some greater heights.
