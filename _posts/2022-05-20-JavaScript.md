# introduction
With the JavaScript assessment due any day now the nerves are wreckening as I saw that I panicked on the last assessment.


# body
I am going to try my best to work on understanding some basic concepts of JavaScript prior to the test so as to not have a breakdown again during the test. Hopefully this will allow me to get through all I need to timeously and without panic.



# conclusion
I hope to prove myself right by actually doing well in a section of work that gave most of us nightmares and was a tad bit difficult to get through.
