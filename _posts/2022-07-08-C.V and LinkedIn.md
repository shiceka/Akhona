# introduction
We had a visit from HWR's Sarah and Claire to discuss proper and more than adequate C.V and LinkedIn
 writing sills.


# body
This workshop was by far a wake up purview that I would love to think was needed by all of us. I saw
 heads nod from a number of students as well as from the ones that are working. The pointers and the 
 things we were told to watch out for and not do were helpful. LinkedIn was also a wake up call which I 
 doubt I would have done myself. The ways and things to do are not difficult but important so as to pop-up.



# conclusion
With this session I feel like we are all almost capable of selling ourselves when it comes to these touched 
on subjects.
