# introduction
The question right now is how far are you on React and can we give you work? 


# body
That is the question as first years we are facing now. Still at the beginning and don't we get to the end of the following month to be done as we were told to not rush as we may rush over important topics. So for everyone I would like to think that we have had to slow down a bit so as to actually take in the concepts learnt and find ways to actually apply.



# conclusion
Class based components are the key factor to learning react but everyone is going on about how outdated it is and that functional based components are the way.
