# introduction
The most of this week has been mostly focused on an app or kata that Njabulo wants from us.


# body
We were to create an app the on the click of a button changed the background color between two colors back and forth. Although thought to be simple at first it turned out to want some thinking. With the help of javascript logic we got it to work.



# conclusion
We had to also add two more buttons and a counter with the counter not going less than 0. Increment button increments the counter and decrement button takes away from the counter.
