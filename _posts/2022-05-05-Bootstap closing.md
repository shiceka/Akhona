# introduction
Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the btn and btn-default classes, as well as the text of Like.


# body
Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as the text that they contain. For example:
<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
This button would only be as wide as the word Submit. By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.



# conclusion
<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
This button would take up 100% of the available width. Note that these buttons still need the btn class.
